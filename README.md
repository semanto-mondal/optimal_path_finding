**Problem Statement**
This is a problem related to the shortest path problem (NP-Hard). Here the goal is to find the shortest path of a knight for two given points where one is the starting and the other one is the ending point respectively. Nothing is mentioned about the chessboard dimensions so it's freely chosen while implementing the problem and given a list of choices to select from those. 

**Solution**
The given problem can be tackled in many different ways. BFS, Bidirectional BFS, and DFS are some of the algorithms which can be utilized to solve this problem. Here I have used BFS and Bi-direction BFS as these are the most appropriate ones to solve problems related to shorted path or path finding where each edge is of equal weight or unweighted.
